		<h1>The Story of Mario</h1>
		
		<p>Mario is a fictional character in the Mario video game franchise by Nintendo, created by Japanese video game designer
		Shigeru Miyamoto. Serving as Nintendo's mascot and the titular protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games 
		since his creation. Though originally only appearing in platform games, starting with Donkey Kong, Mario currently appears in varied 
		video game genres such as racing, puzzle, party, role-playing, fighting, and sports. </p>
		
		<p>Mario is depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian-American plumber who lives in the Mushroom Kingdom. He repeatedly rescues Princess Peach 
		from the turtle-like villain Bowser and stops his numerous plans to destroy him and take over the kingdom. Mario also has other enemies 
		and rivals, including Donkey Kong and Wario. Since 1995, he has been voiced by Charles Martinet.</p>
		
		<p>As Nintendo's mascot, Mario is said to be the most famous character in video game history. Mario games, as a whole, have sold more 
		than 210 million units, making the Mario franchise the best-selling video game franchise of all time. Outside of the Super Mario 
		platform series, he has appeared in video games of other genres, including the Mario Kart racing series, sports games, such as the 
		Mario Tennis and Mario Golf series, role-playing video games such as Paper Mario and Super Mario RPG, and educational games, such as 
		Mario is Missing! and Mario's Time Machine. He has inspired television shows, film, comics, and a line of licensed merchandise.
