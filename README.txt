License Plate Manufacturing is a C++ program created with Visual Studio. The exe is in 
licensePlateManufacturing\Release.

Connect Fourth is a C# program created in Visual Studio. The exe is in
ConnectFourth\bin\Release. In testing this program I ran into a bug that seemed
to happen at random where the computer would be declared the winner even though
they didn't win. I couldn't track it down as it didn't happen every time. So,
the bug still exists.
